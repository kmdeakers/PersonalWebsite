    <p>I am currently a student studying web development at Rithm School. I am very interested in computer technology, and I am excited to see where this career change takes me.  I have a background in graphic design and music production, as well as a degree in studio art from UC Irvine.  I also have extensive experience in the restaurant industry, working as a server, bartender, and manager.  The wide range of different life and work experiences that Iâ€™ve had have helped me hone my communicative and collaborative skills, and I look forward to working alongside others to build great things.</p>
